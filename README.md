# Supply-chain-Dashbaord
📦 Supply Chain Management Dashboard – Power BI
📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Supply Chain Management Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of supply chain operations, enabling stakeholders to monitor capacity, product distribution, cost efficiency, plant performance, warehouse activity, and logistics metrics in real time.

The goal of this dashboard is to help supply chain analysts, operations managers, and decision-makers quickly identify performance trends, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.

🎯 Objectives

Monitor daily production capacity across manufacturing plants.

Track product distribution and plant utilization.

Analyze transportation rates and logistics performance.

Evaluate cost per unit across warehouses and carriers.

Provide dynamic filtering for quick operational insights.

📌 Key KPIs Displayed
KPI	Description
Count of Product ID	Total number of products in the system
Sum of Daily Capacity	Total daily production capacity
Sum of Cost/Unit	Total logistics and operational cost per unit
Sum of Rate	Total transportation rate across carriers
TPT Day Count	Total transportation processing time

📈 Dashboard Components & Explanation

1️⃣ Sum of Daily Capacity & Product Count by Plant ID

Shows total daily production capacity and number of products produced per plant.

Helps identify high-performing and low-performing plants.

Useful for capacity planning and production balancing.

2️⃣ Product Count by Plant Code

Displays product distribution across plant codes.

Identifies plants with higher product flow.

Supports production planning and supply allocation.

3️⃣ TPT Day Count & Rate by Plant Code

Visualizes transport processing time and logistics rate.

Helps in identifying transportation delays and cost inefficiencies.

4️⃣ Daily Capacity by Plant ID

Highlights capacity utilization trends.

Supports production optimization and demand forecasting.

5️⃣ Rate by Carrier

Shows transportation cost by carrier.

Enables carrier performance evaluation and cost comparison.

6️⃣ Cost per Unit by Carrier Type

Donut chart illustrating cost distribution across carrier types.

Useful for logistics strategy and carrier selection.

7️⃣ Cost per Unit by Warehouse (WH)

Tree map visualization representing warehouse-level cost contributions.

Identifies high-cost warehouses for optimization opportunities.

🎛 Interactive Filters (Slicers)

Plant Code

Plant ID

Origin Port

Warehouse (WH)

divergThese filters allow users to dynamically slice the data and perform deep-dive analysis based on business needs.

🚀 Key Business Insights Enabled
